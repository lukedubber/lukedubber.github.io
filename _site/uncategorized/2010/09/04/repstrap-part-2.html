<p>So if anyone ever reads this might wonder why go with a RepStrap well I think I was inspired by <a href="http://www.onshoulders.org/" rel="external nofollow">Gavilan</a>. He had a good a point about building and what he learned.
<blockquote>However, I now know how to write firmware and hostware to interface with microcontrollers, thermistors, endstops, and microstepping motors. I know how to solder through hole and surface mount components. I know how to model CAD parts to spec, and design schematics and circuit boards with Eagle. All this with only a software engineering background.

I am more from the software engineer side (self taught). I have most of the basic things I need already since I dabble in the Arduino.</p>

<p>So I hope to gain more knowledge and insight. Also it will be really cool, I think my son who is four who loves robots, space and now Mario Brothers will really enjoy the things I can make for him and the things we can make together.</p>

<p>My dream goal would be to expand upon this and to make a more accurate version that can compete with the professional models.
I have looked at the <a href="http://store.makerbot.com/cupcake-cnc/cupcake-cnc-basic.html"><em>CupCake CNC</em> - MakerBot Industries</a> but I want to learn more then just making a kit. Also in the long run it would be fun to see how cheap you could make one.</p>
