So I got my Oculus Rift in! It's awesome! But I get nasty case of motion sickness, seems to be mainly when I am in Half-Life 2.

I also see the 'screen door' effect where you can see the black lines between pixels, given time your brain filters it out. 
But its new tech and overall I am impressed. I hope to get over the motion sickness or also called simulator sickness.
I think a fan will help. It seems I get it the worst when I step backwards in HL2. The demos like Tuscany and the coaster don't seem to bother me as much.

Also got a new Nvidia Geforce GTX 770, I need an upgrade.
