So I have not updated recently, just been busy, started a new/old job.

Post(s) to come are:

China Experiment
================
I went on eBay and purchased some Arudino clones and other hardware that is cheaper direct from eBay than it is from the bigger sites. So far I can say awesome savings and everything works so far! Longer more detailed post will come about each item how the pins are laid out any documentation I gathered and will post it. That way others maybe can find my site and it will help them.

JACK
====
Its a robot that I am working on (my kids wanted a robot and well this happened)Â  that will end up maybe having its own software stack and platform. Based around the Raspberry Pi and Android for the remote control.
Progress so far!

Gertboard

Will be reviewing that here soon, excited to see what I can do with it, all the reviews I have read say its a great little board very open ended.
