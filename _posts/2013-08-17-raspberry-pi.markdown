title: Raspberry Pi

So I finally got a Raspberry Pi, I went with the model B of course. I also went a little crazy and got this as well from Adafruit.

- 1 ea. MCP3008 - 8-Channel 10-Bit ADC With SPI Interface</td>
- 1 ea. ADS1015 12-Bit ADC - 4 Channel with Progrmmable Gain Amplifier</td>
- 1 ea. SD/MicroSD Memory Card (4 GB SDHC)</td>
- 1 ea. Raspberry Pi Model B 512MB RAM</td>
- 1 ea. Adafruit Pi T-Cobbler Breakout Kit for Raspberry Pi</td>
- 1 ea. Adafruit Pi Case- Enclosure for Raspberry Pi Model A or B</td>
- 1 ea. HDMI Cable - 1 meter</td>
- 1 ea. GPIO Ribbon Cable for Raspberry Pi</td>
- 1 ea. 4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic Level Converter</td>
- 1 ea. 8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter</td>
- 1 ea. Membrane LED Keypad + extras</td>
- 1 ea. Membrane 3x4 Matrix Keypad + extras</td>
- 1 ea. Monochrome 1.3" 128x64 OLED graphic display</td>
- 2 ea. Breadboarding wire bundle</td>
- 1 ea. Miniature WiFi (802.11b/g/n) Module: For Raspberry Pi and more</td>
- 1 ea. 3.5mm Stereo to RCA (Composite Audio) Cable 6 feet</td>

Not sure what I am going to do with it all yet. I think my main goal is to output some hardware data to the OLED screen. Maybe the CPU info and Chip Serial etc. And give it a menu...

This should be fun!
