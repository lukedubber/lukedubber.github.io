So my wife got me a early birthday gift, well more like I bugged her to let me open it weeks early. It was the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11236?" target="_blank">SparkFun Inventor's Kit for Arduino with Retail case</a>!<img class="alignleft" src="https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/images/products/1/1/2/3/6/11236-Box_medium.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="188" />

She as worried I would not like it since I have most the hardware in the kit, but I was pretty pumped, it has everything I need and the book. As of now I mainly just play and kind of understand electronics my end goal is to really understand it and I think this kit will help. Also its from SparkFun, so that's a total win and as other will say never hurts to have more then one.

My wife is awesome.

Also image I snagged from the official website.
