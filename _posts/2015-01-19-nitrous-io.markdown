title: Nitrous.io, my review
---

So as I write this review; I am doing so on one of my [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io)
boxes; this one I use for playing around with Ruby/Rails.

I use my Ruby box mostly for making my [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site that you are reading right now.

I first started out using the free one and after a few months of fiddling around with it,
I decided to pay for a subscription. So far... Pretty happy.

It lets me play around with:

* Ruby/Rails
* Node.js
* Python/Django
* Go
* PHP
* Meteor

Without having install apps on my Linux or Windows boxes. It just works.

It has:

* web based terminal so I can run most Linux commands I need
* git support
* collaboration with others
* syntax highlighting
* since this is a web app I can access it anywhere

I have had a few issue one of which is listed bellow, but overall pretty pleased with it.

I do feel like their [desktop app](https://www.nitrous.io/desktop) is more refined for Mac then Windows.

If you have some spare cash and don't want to hassle of setting up a Dev box for the languages above
I would recommend try this out.

Issues

> As of this writing (2015-01-19) there is still a bug in JS syntax highlighting.
> Upon using 'use strict'; in my Node.js box, it seems to make all the syntax highlighting act weird.
> This was reported to their team as a bug but nothing has happened. That was six over months ago.
