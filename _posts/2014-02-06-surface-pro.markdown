title: Surface Pro

<p>
So I caved over the weekend and picked up a first gen Surface Pro. It was a great deal I could not pass, $400 off the 128GB model. <br>
So at $499 I got
<ul>
	<li>1920-by-1080 display</li>
	<li>Pen input (Wacom)</li>
	<li>Intel Core i5-3317U (1.7GHz)</li>
	<li>128 GB Solid State</li>
	<li>4gb Ram :(</a>
</ul>
Ram is the only part I was bummed out about, the i5 CPU has Hypervisor support but with 4GB does not give you much, but for $499 its hard to pass up.
</br>
I did pick up a keyboard and a warranty that added a bit.

<br />

Cannot wait for it to come in! <br /><br />

Oh and I can put Linux on it ;)
