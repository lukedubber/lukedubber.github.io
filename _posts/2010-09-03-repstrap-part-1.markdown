So I have been looking at the <a href="http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">RepRap </a>for a while (RepRap is an open source rapid prototype 3d printer) and have not been into it much until I ran across a post on <a href="hackaday.com/2010/08/29/from-repstrap-to-reprap-a-3d-printer-is-born/">hackaday</a> about a guy who created a RepStrap which is a kind of hand built version of the Darwin (v1) to a Mendel unit (v2).

Now what got me was that he built a RepStrap which I was unaware of; which then helps you make the parts to turn your RepStrap into a RepRap or make the Mendel version. So now I have decided to look into making my own with the end goal of turning my RepStrap to a RepRap and then make a Mendel. This guys have some great links and posts about it and I hope to start up a conversation about it soon.
